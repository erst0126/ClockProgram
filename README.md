DIGITAL CLOCK PROGRAM

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The scenario for this school project was that you were a recent graduate, interveiwing at a tech comapany. As part of the interveiw process, you are asked to do a "audition". You were then given a problem statement and a list of requirements that your code would need to meet. The problem statement was this:

"Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock."

Your task was to create two clocks, 12-hour and 24-hour, that will allow user input of seconds, minutes, and hours. You are given a design for the output of the program, as well as a flowchart explaining everything the program needs to do and in what order.

2) What did you do particularly well?

I tried really hard to pay attention to detail in terms of the clock display, and I feel like I did pretty well in that aspect. I also think that my code looks nice in terms of spacing, having it spaced out like that can make it easier to follow and read.

3) What could you do better and what would it improve?

I think that I don't use enough in-line comments which are a good practice because they can help explain code and make it easier to understand. I also think that I could have set the clock to read the systems time instead of a specific time. That would make more sense and make it easier for the user to see the 12-hour and 24-hour times. One of my displays has in error in the coding, causing a graphical glitch in the display. Fixing that would fix the graphic issue, the clock and menu still work with or without the graphic issue.

4) What part of the code was the most challenging and how did you overcome it?

I would say that Writing the code in general was challenging, I definitely used a lot of resources (listed below) to help me with the code.

5) What resources will you add to your support network?

-GeeksforGeeks
-StackOverflow

6) How will the skills from this project help with future projects?

Every skill is useful in programming really, at some point you will use something you learn. Learning to pay attention to detail and follow a flowchart to write code are very important, as well as learning the best standard practice for the language. 

7) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Well, i used spacing to try and make it easier to read. Unfortunately, I didn't use in line comments often which can help even more with explaining function and helping the reader understand.
